# Weekly Task 8
# Author : Agnieszka Waszczuk
# 
# Write a program called plottask.py that displays:
# a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, 
# and a plot of the function  h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 10], 
#on the one set of axes.
#Some marks will be given for making the plot look nice (legend etc)


# Work in progress!!!!

from numpy import random
x = random.normal(size=(0, 10000))

print(x)

mean = 5
standard_deviation = 5
