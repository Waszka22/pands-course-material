#Create a file called testTypes.py, in the file create 5 variables one for each of
#the following types: int, float, boolean, str, list (look at w3schools.com)
#Use the type() function to check that the variables are of that type. Your
#program should output.

i = 3

fl = 3.5

isa = True
memo = 'how now Brown Cow'
lots = []

print('variable {} is of type:{} and value:{}'.format('i', type(i), i))
print('variable {} is of type:{} and value:{}'.format('fl', type(fl), fl))
print('variable {} is of type:{} and value:{}'.format('is', type(isa), isa))
print('variable {} is of type:{} and value:{}'.format('memo', type(memo), memo))
print('variable {} is of type:{} and value:{}'.format('lots', type(lots), lots))
